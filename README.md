Panel Data and Numpy Utils
====================

Python and numpy based library for housing, examining and modeling panel data. Some additional numpy utilities are implemented.

### Notable modules:
- **datab** :
numpy recarray subclass, for housing tabular data. Keeps track of formatting of the fields, and has methods for data inspection and disk I/O.

- **stats** :
Keep track of (optionally weighted) descriptive statistics of incoming data, handling nans. Handles bivariate data, and two-dimensional data.

- **regress** :
Perform multivariate weighted linear regression, handling nans and returning
associated statistics.
